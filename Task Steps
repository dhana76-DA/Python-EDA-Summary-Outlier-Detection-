Steps Done: 
Dataset download link: https://github.com/zeyongj/House-Prices-Advanced-Regression-Techniques/blob/main/train.csv

Loading the dataset in googe colab:
import pandas as pd
url = "/content/train.csv"                  # Load dataset from Local system. 
df = pd.read_csv(url)
df.head()                                     # Display first 5 rows
print("Dataset Shape:", df.shape)            # Check shape
print("\nDataset Info:")

df.info()                                     # Check dataset info

df.describe()                                  # Generate descriptive statistics
The descriptive statistics show that the average house sale price is around 1.8 lakh, with a large standard deviation, indicating high variability in house prices. The dataset contains 1460 records and 81 features. The lot area and sale price show wide ranges, suggesting the presence of potential outliers, making this dataset suitable for outlier detection.

The dataset contains several columns with high percentages of missing values. Features such as PoolQC, MiscFeature, Alley, and Fence have more than 80% missing values, indicating these attributes are mostly unavailable and may be removed or carefully imputed. Columns like LotFrontage and garage-related features show moderate missing values, which require appropriate data cleaning techniques before analysis.

# Calculate missing value percentage for each column
missing_percent = (df.isnull().sum() / len(df)) * 100

# Convert to DataFrame and sort
missing_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Missing Values %': missing_percent
}).sort_values(by='Missing Values %', ascending=False)
missing_df.head(20)

Histograms:
Show distribution of values (normal, skewed, etc.)
Helps identify skewed features (like SalePrice, LotArea)

Boxplots:
Show median, quartiles, and outliers
Outliers appear as dots outside the whiskers
Features like SalePrice, LotArea, GrLivArea often have extreme outliers
Using .dropna() ensures missing values don’t break the plots.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import math

# Select numerical columns
num_cols = df.select_dtypes(include=['int64', 'float64']).columns
n_cols = 4  # number of subplots per row
n_rows = math.ceil(len(num_cols) / n_cols)  # compute rows needed

# Histograms
plt.figure(figsize=(20, 5*n_rows))                               #plt.figure(figsize=(20, 5*n_rows)) → adjusts figure height automatically.
for i, col in enumerate(num_cols):
    plt.subplot(n_rows, n_cols, i+1)
    plt.hist(df[col].dropna(), bins=30, color='skyblue', edgecolor='black')
    plt.title(f'Histogram of {col}')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Boxplots
plt.figure(figsize=(20, 5*n_rows))                #plt.figure(figsize=(20, 5*n_rows)) → adjusts figure height automatically.
for i, col in enumerate(num_cols):
    plt.subplot(n_rows, n_cols, i+1)
    plt.boxplot(df[col].dropna())
    plt.title(f'Boxplot of {col}')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()


Histograms reveal that features such as SalePrice and LotArea are right-skewed, meaning there are a few very large values. Boxplots confirm this and highlight extreme outliers, which can be further handled using IQR or Z-score methods. Features like OverallQual or YearBuilt are more evenly distributed, showing less extreme variation.
