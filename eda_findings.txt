Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) — House Prices Dataset
=======================================================

1. Dataset Overview
------------------
- Number of rows: 1460
- Number of columns: 81
- Dataset contains various numerical and categorical features related to house attributes and sale prices.

2. Missing Values
-----------------
- Columns with high missing values (>50%):
  - PoolQC: 99.5%
  - MiscFeature: 96.3%
  - Alley: 93.8%
  - Fence: 80.8%
- Moderate missing values:
  - LotFrontage: 17.7%
  - Garage-related columns: ~5%
- Recommendation:
  - Drop columns with very high missing values.
  - Impute moderate missing values with median or mode depending on feature type.

3. Descriptive Statistics
-------------------------
- SalePrice:
  - Mean: 180,921
  - Std: 79,442
  - Min: 34,900
  - Max: 755,000
- LotArea and SalePrice are right-skewed, indicating the presence of extreme values (outliers).

4. Outlier Detection (IQR Method)
---------------------------------
- Outlier definition: Values below Q1 - 1.5*IQR or above Q3 + 1.5*IQR
- Features with significant outliers:
  - LotFrontage: 259
  - GrLivArea: 50
  - SalePrice: 28
- Outlier Flag:
  - Created 'Outlier_Flag' column: 0 = no outlier, 1 = at least one outlier
  - Rows with outliers: ~900
  - Rows without outliers: ~560

5. Outlier Handling
------------------
- Strategy:
  - Cap extreme values using IQR bounds (Winsorization) for numerical features to preserve all rows.
  - Alternatively, remove extreme outliers for very skewed features if necessary.
- Reason:
  - Prevent distortion of mean, std, and correlations while keeping dataset size sufficient for analysis.

6. Distribution Analysis
------------------------
- Histograms:
  - SalePrice, LotArea, GrLivArea are right-skewed.
  - Features like OverallQual and YearBuilt show near-uniform distribution.
- Boxplots:
  - Outliers are visually confirmed for SalePrice, LotArea, GrLivArea, and LotFrontage.

7. Correlation Analysis
-----------------------
- Top correlations with SalePrice:
  1. OverallQual: 0.79
  2. GrLivArea: 0.71
  3. GarageCars: 0.64
  4. GarageArea: 0.62
  5. TotalBsmtSF: 0.61
  6. 1stFlrSF: 0.60
  7. FullBath: 0.56
  8. TotRmsAbvGrd: 0.53
  9. YearBuilt: 0.52
- Insights:
  - Overall quality, living area, garage size, and basement area are the strongest predictors of house price.
  - Number of rooms and bathrooms also contribute moderately.
  - Newer houses tend to have higher prices.

8. Summary / Key Findings
-------------------------
- House prices are influenced strongly by quality, area, and garage features.
- Dataset contains many missing values; high-missing columns should be dropped or carefully imputed.
- Outliers exist in several numerical features, can be handled by capping to reduce their impact.
- Correlation analysis helps in **feature selection** for predictive modeling.
- Cleaned dataset is ready for **modeling or further analysis**.

9. Actions Taken
----------------
- Missing values identified and planned for imputation.
- Outliers detected and capped using IQR method.
- Outlier_Flag column created for reference.
- Descriptive statistics and correlations analyzed.
- Dataset exported as 'house_prices_cleaned.csv'.
